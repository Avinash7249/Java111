//An Interface in Java is defined as an abstract type used to specify the behaviour of a
///class. An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. A Java interface contains static
//constants and abstract methods.
//The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve 100% abstraction. There can be only
//abstract methods in the Java interface, not the method body. It is used to achieve
//abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
