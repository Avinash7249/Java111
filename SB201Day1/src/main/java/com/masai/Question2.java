	//What Is Spring IOC? Why is it needed?
	//ans:  if some external entity is taking care of creating the dependency 
	//object then we say that control is inverted to some external entity, this 
	//is called Inversion of Control (IOC)
	
	//The most valuable benefit of using an IoC container is that you can have a 
	//configuration switch in one place which lets you change between,
	//say, test mode and production mode. 
	//The Spring container is responsible for instantiating, configuring and assembling
	//objects known as beans, as well as managing their life cycles.
