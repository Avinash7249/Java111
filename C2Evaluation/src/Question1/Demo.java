//Difference

// For example,
//if a class Bulb inherits another class Device,then we can say that Bulb is having is-a 
//relationship with Device, which implies Bulb is a device.

//Has-a means “Car has Engine”, and strongly associated, it means Engine object is composed 
//inside the class Car.

// an apple is a fruit.So you will extend fruit to get apple. On the other hand, composition means
//creating instances which have references to other objects.












//Access Modifires

//The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be
//accessed from outside the class.

//The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot
//be accessed from outside the package. Aka package-protected. If you do not
//specify any access level, it will be the default.

// The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and
//outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot
//be accessed from outside the package.

//The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the
//class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package.
